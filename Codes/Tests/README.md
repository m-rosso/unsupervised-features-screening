## Unsupervised screening of features - Codes (Tests)

This folder specifically contains Python scripts used during tests, thus being present here just for the sake of saving them, since they are not directly reproducible without private databases used in those scripts.

**Quick note:** during tests the class *screening_continuous* refers to *VarScreeningNumerical*.
