## Unsupervised screening of features - Codes

This folder contains codes that I have used during tests. The main Python script, however, is named *screening_features.py*, which contains two classes: *screening_continuous* and *screening_categorical*, for numerical and categorical variables, respectively. Each class has its own documentation, presenting inputs for initialization, methods and output objects. Finally, a HTML file presents a demo for implementation.
