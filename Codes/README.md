## Unsupervised screening of features - Codes

This folder contains codes that I have used during tests. The main Python script, however, is named *screening_features.py*, which contains three classes: *VarScreeningNumerical*, *VarScreeningCategorical* and *CorrScreeningNumerical*, for variance selection of numerical and categorical variables, plus selection based on correlation of numerical variables. Each class has its own documentation, presenting inputs for initialization, methods and output objects. Finally, a Jupyter notebook presents a demo for implementation.
